# Penetration Testing Fundamentals

# **Penetration Testing Methodologies**

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Information Gathering | This stage involves collecting as much publicly accessible
information about a target/organization as possible, for example
OSINT and research

This does not involve scanning systems |
| Enumeration/Scanning | This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems.

For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable. |
| Exploitation | This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application.

This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic. |
| Privilege Escalation | Once you have exploited a system and have access, this stage is where you attempt to expand your access to a system.
You can escalate horizontally and vertically,
			where horizontally is accessing another account of the same
			permission group. And escalating vertically is accessing another
			user that is of another permission group (an admin) |
| Post-exploitation | This stage involves a few sub-stages:

1. What other hosts can be targeted
			(pivoting)

2. What additional information can we gather
			from the host now that we are a privileged user?

3. Covering your tracks

4. Reporting |
